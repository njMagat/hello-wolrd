**Trying out git feautures**


# First creating a Repository in the upper right corner with the "+" icon, and clicking new repository
# Second ubnderstanding what branch is. Branch is like cloning or copying the main branch then trying to add 
# features/changes to your previous code without ruining it. Merge it in the `Main Branch` if you're done.
# Third is learning what is commit. In laymans term, it is saving changes. It comes with "Commit Change Box"
# wherein you can add a short description of what changes you've made.
